# Bike Buyer Data Analysis with Excel

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis process using Microsoft Excel, focusing on a dataset of potential bike buyers. The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques to derive insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Duplicate Removal**: Utilized Excel's built-in functionality (Data Tab > Data Tools > Remove Duplicates) to ensure data integrity by eliminating duplicate entries.

### 2. Data Quality Enhancement
- **Standardization of Categorical Variables**: 
  - **Marital Status**: Expanded abbreviations (M -> Married, S -> Single)
  - **Gender**: Converted single-letter codes to full words (F -> Female, M -> Male)
- **Data Type Correction**: 
  - **Income Column**: Reformatted from Currency to General for more flexible analysis.

### 3. Data Transformation
- **Age Categorization**: Implemented custom binning to group ages into meaningful categories, enhancing demographic analysis capabilities.

### 4. Advanced Analysis
- **Pivot Table Creation**: Developed multiple pivot tables in a separate sheet to facilitate multi-dimensional analysis of the data.

### 5. Data Visualization
- **Chart Generation**: Created various charts to visually represent key findings and trends in the data.
